# LineFollower

This is our last project for the Introduction to Robotics course at the University of Bucharest, where we're diving into making a line follower. It's a hands-on challenge where the requirement is to design a robot to follow a marked path accurately and in the shortest possible time. To achieve this, we used PID, a control loop mechanism employing feedback.
